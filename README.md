# Tracky - ASG team tracker

The idea of this project is to create an application and a server that allows you to track your (or the opposite) team (e.g. in ASG games). The project is in an early phase and will be improved to come into the Google Play store. When the project will be ready enough to be uploaded to the Play store it will appear on this account: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=SlowCast.
